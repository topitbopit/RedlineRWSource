## Redline Rewrite Source
This repo contains the source code + resource files for the cancelled rewrite of Redline.

## What is Redline?
[Redline](https://github.com/topitbopit/Redline) is one of my other projects that I've been working on for a long time. Because I've been working on it for so long, I've gone through several different styles of writing and optimization, causing the source to be really messy.

## Why make a rewrite?
Several months ago, I decided to create a rewrite from scratch so I could get rid of bad code while also adding new functionality. Everything was going good until about 6000 lines in when I started to run into feature creep. I felt like it would've taken too long to finish this version and provide all of the features I said I would, so I slowly decided to stop working on it, effectively discontinuing the rewrite.

Nearly 5 months later, I've decided to release the source code along with all of the required files so they won't go to waste. You're free to use my code, use certain assets (sounds and icons), or simply use it as a learning resource.

## What now?
My current plans are to clean up the original Redline instead of abandoning it. So far I've rewritten around 1200 lines with only ~8000 left (ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³)! Once I get the current Redline to a state where I'm comfortable, I *may* consider continuing this rewritten version. Until then, here it is.
